I needed to work with data from the federal government, but I had so many projects to tackle, I needed to standardize how I'm working with the core data sources. I went to the existing government developers portal and the web services section, and none it was acceptable for me to use in my projects.

I needed a standardized way to hange data and APIs within a portal that met my "building block" standards. I knew I wanted it to run on Github and be portable, so that anyone can use as a template for their own projects, in addition to me replicating as I needed for my projects.

The result of my work is this Dev Hub portal, which I'm intending to use for my own projects, but also hopefully encourage others at the VA and beyond to build off my work.

This project is in a work in progress, and I hope to keep refining over my time in DC. Stay tuned and return often to keep up to date on the changes I'm making.
